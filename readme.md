### On some resources a content is dynamic. In this regard the webdriver (Firefox) is used
You can also use it without a webdriver to get a SOCKS5 proxy from resources without dynamic content.

To use the driver, you need to download `geckodriver` from ( https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases ) and put it in the `bin/`
And run with the -d flag:
```commandline
$ python main.py -d
```

Without using the Firefox webdriver:
```commandline
$ python main.py
```

After receiving the socks5 proxy list, the proxies are checked using HTTP requests (script `checker.py`).

The available socks5 proxies are stored in the `socks_list/` directory.

#### Good luck!
